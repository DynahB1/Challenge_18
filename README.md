# **Challenge_18**

---

## *This exercise will guide you through a basic code that would create a blockchain using python libraries*

## Python allows you to add the sender and receiver of a transaction by allowing input as a string through the streamlit interface, which will also allow the user to add the amount of the transaction as a float.
